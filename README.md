Description of Website:
The website is an E-Portfolio that introduces the user to me and uses multiple pages to separate all of the different information. It has small animations like making something pop out when hovering over the item or popping up when the page is loaded. It has a contact section where people can feel free to email me if they want to ask anything. The site has images of my previous projects, such as the two motor powered gear cart and fan cart. Those were fun to make and worked out well, overall in the class they were both in the top 3 in terms of speed. Those projects show off my simple circuit building and engineering design skills. When on a mobile device, the website will adjust and fit everything correctly. There’s also a slider in the top right to change from dark mode to light. 

Challenges Faced:
I didn’t face many challenges, but originally my home page file’s name wasn’t index.html which messes up the way the website functions, so once that was changed everything was working as expected. The AI was able to fix any programming issues with the styling of the website quickly.
